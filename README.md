#PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

  In this project the CEO V. Isualize and manager Omar asked us to create a summary Data Frame from ride sharing data by city type and a multi-line graph to compare weekly fares for each city type to summarize our findings through utilizing jupyter notebook.  


## Results

  Based on our summary Data Frame we can see the Urban city type has the most total rides and total drivers when compared to the other city types.  With more drivers and rides we can directly relate that this city type will a higher total fare and we can confirm this assumption is true based on our summary data. Even though the Urban city type had the highest total fares when compared to both Suburban and Rural City types it has lower average fare per ride and the average fare per driver. 

  After reviewing the Total by city Type graph, we can see the date range with the highest Total Fares for the Suburban and Urban city types is at the end of February.  At the start of April, the Urban and Rural city types start to decline for the end of the month while Suburban spikes in total fares. 


	For suburban city type right after its peak at the end of February the total fares drop significantly.  When compared to the other city types none of them have this significant decrease. 


## Summary

  With the Urban city type having the most fares at the end of February we should have the most drivers during this time of the year and increase fares to have the highest possible total fares for February. With higher fares we can increase the average fare per ride and average fare per drivers.

  Since the Suburban city type has its lowest fares in early March, we should lower prices with an attempt to increase the number of rides for this period.  

  The Rural city type has its highest fare amount in April, like the urban city strategy we should have the highest number of drivers available during this time while having higher fares to increase our total fares for this city type.
